        <p>
          My name is Julie, and I am a Danish, passionate and curious multimedia
          design student entering my second year at KEA. The first years as a
          student consisted of a lot of trial and error and resulted in me
          gaining a solid foundation in front-end development, including HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, as well as an understanding of design theory and
          conventions. During this summer vacation, I have been learning the
          React framework, which I used to create this resume. In the upcoming
          semester, our focus will be exclusively on front-end development, with
          an emphasis on React. I am excited to deepen my understanding of this
          framework that I have already come to enjoy. For details on my
          expertise with different frameworks and design tools, please see the
          section below. I am currently seeking a part-time job where I can
          apply my skills in front-end development and contribute to real-world
          projects, while continuing to grow both technically and creatively
